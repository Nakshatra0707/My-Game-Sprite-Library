# My Library Usage
This is a guide as to how to use my video game library.
The all-important file is 'my_library.js' where you'll find the source code of the functions used.

HOW TO USE:
Refer to 'how-to-use.js'

MUST HAVE:
The 'p5.js' and 'p5.play.js' are necessary for creating sprites and using certain functions, if you are running my code without adding these files, the code will not work.
'index.html' is the main html page where all the JavaScript files are linked.
